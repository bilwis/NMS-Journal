# NMS-Journal
A Catalogue and Journal System for No Man's Sky.

This is designed to run on a local server or a secure website (with SSL and OAuth) to enable a user (currently only one user) to catalogue their discoveries within No Man's Sky and to add journal entries with rich HTML, provided by TinyMCE.

This repository won't be of much use without the SQL files to set up the database and tables, and without the libraries (such as jQuery, tinyMCE, Google API, flexdatalist, etc.), which may or may not be added at a later time.

Currently, this is more of a versioning enabled backup for myself. I can not promise that this'll ever be finished or that I will release it under any form of license, but you are free to look around the source if you somehow got lost and found my repo. 

Take care, Traveller!
